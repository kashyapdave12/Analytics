# GraduateAdmissionPrediction - For dataset and Implementation - Main Branch

This project helps to identify whether or not a student will recieve an admit from the University based on the independent variables - "GRE, TOEFL, SOP, LOR, CGPA, University Ranking and Research Work"

There is a dependent variable "Chance of Admit" which we will predict using the Supervised Learning Model - Multiple Linear Regression.

Also, we can classify the "Chance of Admit" 0 or 1 with the help of Random Forest Classifier.

Finally, the model performance is evaluated.
